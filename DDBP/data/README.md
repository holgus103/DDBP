The first 16 give West's hand, with suits separated by periods.  Then there is a space.  The next 16 characters give North's hand, then East's, and then South's.  Then there is a colon, followed by 20 results (in hexadecimal).  The first four refer to NT: the number of tricks that can be taken by N/S with S leading, then E, then N, then W.  The next four refer to S trumps, then H trumps, then D trumps, and finally C trumps.
